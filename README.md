## üí° Story
Many people are looking for specifical plants or flowers which sometimes are not easy to find locally.
On the other hand, there are people who can have too many flowers because each of them grow up. 
So instead of throwing their plants in the trash, they could sell or share them.


Also pationnate about plants, that's why I wanted to create FindMyPlant.

## üîç Objective of this project
For this project, I wanted to give more control to the backend and improve the security with more access control.

I also wanted to improve my knowledges with Docker and CI/CD with Github actions.

My development environment has been built with Docker, no need to install dependencies in my local machine.
You build it, you run it ! üöÄ

This project is fully deployed online.
